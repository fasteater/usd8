# USD8 - a new stablecoin covers crypto hacks

USD8 is a stablecoin that offers cover for crypto hacks by operating a Cover Pool from its own revenue, allowing hacking victims to claim losses from the pool.

# TLDR;
Like USDC, but set aside a % treasury yield to cover defi hacks.

# Why
- Crypto hacks remain a major roadblock for DeFi adoption
- Current industry solutions focus on preventing hacks with audits, but this does not guarantee security and thus does not solve users' pain points

# How
- Users mint USD8 with USDC, USDC goes into treasury for yield. Part of the yield profit is set aside into a Cover Pool to cover potential hacks
- Users use/hold/LP/yield with USD8 to accumulate Cover Credits (non-transferrable) which they can use to claim any type of hacking loss from covered protocols
- Claims are limited by:
    - the user's total loss
    - the overall Cover Pool size
    - the coverage rate for the hacked protocol
- A committee of third party industry KOLs determines if a hack is legit and should be covered
- Claiming process is permissionless and non-reversible, users might need to trade in their hacked protocol LP token if applicable.
