USD8 is a stablecoin that offers cover for crypto hacks by operating a Cover Pool from its own revenue, allowing hacking victims to claim losses from the pool.

# Why
- Crypto hacks remain a major roadblock for DeFi adoption
- Current industry solutions focus on preventing hacks with audits, but this does not guarantee security and thus does not solve users' pain points

# How
- USD8 maintains a Cover Pool from its own revenue, then vets and offers permissionless coverage for selected DeFi protocols
- USD8 tokens can be borrowed with a CDP using USDC as collateral
- Users accumulate Cover Score by holding and using USD8 in yield, LP. Cover Score is non-transferable
- Users can claim losses from the Cover Pool after a hack, this process does not require Cover Score, but the more Cover Score, the more claim weight a user has
- Claims are limited by:
    - the user's total loss
    - the overall Cover Pool size
    - the coverage rate for the hacked protocol
- A group of third party industry KOLs determines if a hack is legit and should be covered
- Claiming process is permissionless and non-reversible, users are required to trade in their hacked protocol LP token. 

More details coming soon...
